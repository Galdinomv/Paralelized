Different ordering of floating point operations due to different
optimization levels with gcc can generate slightly different answers
for this code.  One problem I encountered was with sum in ComputeKE.
gcc reorders floating point instructions with -O2 resulting in a
slight difference in the output.  I encountered the following output
with one iteration. 

With -g -O2:

    0    2216.2646  -14174.5956  -11958.3310   0.7218  -6.0888   0.1957  46.9

With -g: 

    0    2216.2638  -14174.5956  -11958.3318   0.7218  -6.0888   0.1957  46.9
